            <h2><a href="">I LEARNED THINGS</a></h2>
            <p>**Me, a raccoon, learning Django:**</p>  

            <p>Alright, so I found this glowing rectangle humans call a "laptop." Thought it was a food box at first. It is not. But it does have *power.*</p>  

            <p>Started learning Django because the human left their screen unlocked, and I saw something about "web apps" and "databases." Figured, hey, if I can open a locked trash can, I can figure this out.</p>  

            <ol>
                <li>**Step 1: Install Django**</li>  
                <p>Typed `pip install django` with my little raccoon fingers. It worked. Felt unstoppable.</p>  

                <li>**Step 2: Start a project**</li>  
                <p>Ran `django-admin startproject trashKingdom`. Made a whole folder full of files I do not understand. Exciting and terrifying. Like finding an unopened bag of chips.</p>  

                <li>**Step 3: Views and URLs**</li>  
                <p>Tried making a page that just says "Hello, garbage world!" Humans use `views.py` for this. Made a function, linked it in `urls.py`. Refreshed the page... and *error messages appeared.* Many. So many.</p>  

                <li>**Step 4: Debugging**</li> 
                p>Googled furiously. Found Stack Overflow. It is like a giant, complicated dumpster filled with knowledge. Sometimes you find treasure. Sometimes you get bitten.</p>  

                <li>**Step 5: Databases? Models?**</li> 
                <p>Django wants me to *migrate* something. Where? Why? I don‚Äôt know, but I ran `python manage.py migrate` and it seemed happy, so I am pretending I understand.</p>  
            </ol>

                <p>**Current status:**</p>  
                <p>I have a working Django app that does one thing: show a page that says ‚ÄúRaccoons Rule.‚Äù It is not much, but it is *mine.* Thinking about adding a database to track the best dumpsters in the city.</p>  

                <p>Tomorrow: Maybe learn about templates. Maybe bite a power cable. We‚Äôll see where the night takes me. ü¶ùüíª</p>
